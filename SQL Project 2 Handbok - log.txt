1. Create a new database in pgAdmin
2. Now in this database create the necessary tables for the project
E.g for the Branch Table
Code:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch (branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
					manager_id	VARCHAR(10),
					branch_address	VARCHAR(55),
					contact_no VARCHAR(10)
					);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees(
					emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,	
					emp_name VARCHAR(25),
					position VARCHAR(15),
					salary INT,
					branch_id VARCHAR(25)
					);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
CREATE TABLE books(
					isbn VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,	
					book_title VARCHAR(75),
					category VARCHAR(15),
					rental_price FLOAT,	
					status VARCHAR(15),
					author VARCHAR(35),
					publisher VARCHAR(55)
					);	

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS members;
CREATE TABLE members(
					member_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,	
					member_name VARCHAR(25),	
					member_address VARCHAR(75),	
					reg_date DATE
					);	

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS issued_status;
CREATE TABLE issued_status(
					issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
					issued_member_id VARCHAR(15),
					issued_book_name VARCHAR(75),
					issued_date DATE,
					issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(35),
					issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
					);	

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS return_status;
CREATE TABLE return_status(
					return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,	
					issued_id VARCHAR(10),	
					return_book_name VARCHAR(75),
					return_date DATE,
					return_book_isbn VARCHAR(35)
					);	

Now that you've created all the tables, its time to make the ERD i.e Entity Relationship Diagram (the FRAMEWORK)

3. Right click on your database and select the "ERD For Database" option
Define the relationships and Add foreign Key Constraints.
Code: 
--Adding Foreign Keys
ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_members
FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id)
REFERENCES members(member_id)

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_books
FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn)
REFERENCES books(isbn);

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_empId
FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id)
REFERENCES employees(emp_id);


ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_issued
FOREIGN KEY (issued_id)
REFERENCES issued_status(issued_id);


ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch
FOREIGN KEY (branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id);


ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_book_isbn
FOREIGN KEY (return_book_isbn)
REFERENCES books(isbn);


(you may also do this WHILE making the table itself)

4. Now populate the tables w data by inserting it.

5. Now lets solve some basic CRUD(create retrieve update delete) questions/do analysis.
||CRUD Operations||

Task 1. Create a New Book Record -- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"
Code:
INSERT INTO books (isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES ('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')
SELECT * FROM books;

Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address
Code:
UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Bang Street'
WHERE member_id='C101';
SELECT * FROM members;

Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table -- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.
Code:
DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS121';
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee -- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.
Code:
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101';

Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book -- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.
Code:
SELECT 
	issued_emp_id, 
	COUNT(issued_id)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(issued_id)>1;

--Having is used with GROUP by

6. CTAS (Create Table As Select) Operations.

Task 6: Create Summary Tables: Use CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**
Code:
CREATE TABLE book_cnts
AS
SELECT 
b.isbn,
b.book_title,
COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_of_issued
FROM books AS b
JOIN
issued_status AS ist
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;


SELECT * FROM book_cnts;

Task 7. Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category:
Code:
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category= 'Classic'

Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category:
Code:
SELECT 
	b.category,
	SUM(b.rental_price),
	COUNT(*)
FROM books AS b
JOIN
issued_status AS ist
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1;

Task 9: List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days:
Code:
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';

Task 10: List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details:
Code:
SELECT e1.*, b.manager_id, e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN 
branch AS b
ON
b.branch_id = e1.branch_id
JOIN
employees as e2
ON b.manager_id = e2.emp_id

Task 11. Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold 7USD:
Code:
CREATE TABLE books_above_7
AS
SELECT * FROM Books
WHERE rental_price > 7

SELECT * FROM books_above_7

Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned
Code:
SELECT DISTINCT ist.* 
FROM issued_status AS ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status AS rs
ON ist.issued_id = rs.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL

7. Moving to the ADVANCE SQL Functions:

Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

-- we've to join issued status w members table and join this w books table and JOIN w return status for overdue
--then we filter books that are returned
--If overdue is greater than 30 days

Code:
SELECT 
	m.member_id, 
	m.member_name, 
	b.book_title, 
	ist.issued_date, 
	CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date AS Over_due_days
FROM issued_status AS ist
INNER JOIN members AS m
ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
INNER JOIN books AS b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN return_status AS rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_date IS NULL 
AND 
(CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1

Task 14: Update Book Status on Return
Write a query to update the status of books in the books table to "Yes" when they are returned (based on entries in the return_status table).

-- you can either do it MANUALLY~ by updating in the return table and Updating the books table.
Code:
INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
VALUES
('RS125','IS130',CURRENT_DATE,'Good')

UPDATE books
SET status = 'yes'
WHERE isbn LIKE '%94-2'

SELECT * FROM books

-- Or you can use code a store procedure
Syntax:
-- Store Procedures
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_return_records()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE

BEGIN 
--All the logics and codes
END;
$$

Code:

-- Store Procedures
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_return_records(p_return_id VARCHAR(10) , p_issued_id VARCHAR(10),p_book_quality VARCHAR(15))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
	v_isbn VARCHAR(50);
	v_book_name VARCHAR(80);

BEGIN
	--All logic goes here
	-- Inserting into returns basesd on user input
	INSERT INTO return_status(return_id, issued_id, return_date, book_quality)
	VALUES
	(p_return_id, p_issued_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_book_quality);

	SELECT 
		issued_book_isbn
		issued_book_name
		INTO 
		v_isbn,
		v_book_name
	FROM issued_status
	WHERE issued_id = p_issued_id;
	
	UPDATE books
	SET status = 'yes'
	WHERE isbn = 'v_isbn';

	RAISE NOTICE 'Thank You for returning the book: %', v_book_name;

END;
$$

and then to test it
Testing code:
CALL add_return_records('R139','IS135','Good');

Task 15: Branch Performance Report
Create a query that generates a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, the number of books returned, and the total revenue generated from book rentals.

Code: 
CREATE TABLE branch_reports 
AS
SELECT 
	br.branch_id,
	br.manager_id,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_of_books_issued,
	COUNT(rs.return_id) AS no_of_books_returned,
	SUM(b.rental_price) AS total_revenue
FROM issued_status AS ist
INNER JOIN employees AS e
ON ist.issued_emp_id = e.emp_id
INNER JOIN branch AS br
ON br.branch_id = e.branch_id
LEFT JOIN return_status AS rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
INNER JOIN books AS b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

Code:
CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members 
WHERE member_id IN (
			SELECT DISTINCT issued_member_id
			FROM issued_status
			WHERE issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL'6 month'
			);

SELECT * FROM active_members;

Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.
Code:

SELECT 
	e.emp_name,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS no_of_books_processed,
	br.*
FROM issued_status AS ist
INNER JOIN employees AS e
ON ist.issued_emp_id = e.emp_id
INNER JOIN branch AS br
ON br.branch_id = e.branch_id
GROUP BY 1,3;

Task 18: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" in the books table. Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.
Code:
SELECT
    m.member_name,
    b.book_title,
    COUNT(*) AS damaged_issue_count
FROM issued_status AS ist
JOIN members AS m
    ON ist.issued_member_id = m.member_id
JOIN books AS b
    ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
WHERE b.status = 'damaged'
GROUP BY
    m.member_name,
    b.book_title
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;


Task 19: Stored Procedure Objective: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows: The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'. If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

Code:
SELECT * FROM books;

SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_a_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(50), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
--all variable here
	v_status VARCHAR(10);
	
BEGIN
--all logic here
--Checking if book is available (status=yes)
	SELECT 
		status 
		INTO
		v_status
	FROM books 
	WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

	IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

		INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
		VALUES (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

		UPDATE  books
			SET status = 'no'
			WHERE isbn = issued_book_isbn;

		RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : %', p_issued_book_isbn;
	ELSE
		RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry to inform you, but the book you have requested is unavailable book isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
	END IF;

END;
$$

CALL issue_a_book ('IS155','C108','978-0-375-41398-8','E104');

Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS) Objective: Create a CTAS (Create Table As Select) query to identify overdue books and calculate fines.

Description: Write a CTAS query to create a new table that lists each member and the books they have issued but not returned within 30 days. The table should include: The number of overdue books. The total fines, with each day's fine calculated at $0.50. The number of books issued by each member. The resulting table should show: Member ID Number of overdue books Total fines
Code:
CREATE TABLE overdue_fines_summary AS
SELECT
    ist.issued_member_id AS member_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (
        WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL
          AND CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date > 30
    ) AS overdue_books,
    
    COUNT(*) AS total_books_issued,
    
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN rs.return_id IS NULL
             AND CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date > 30
            THEN (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date - 30) * 0.50
            ELSE 0
        END
    ) AS total_fines
FROM issued_status AS ist
LEFT JOIN return_status AS rs
